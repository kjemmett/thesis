\chapter{Quantifying Reticulation Using Topological Complex Constructions}
\label{ch:complex_construction}

\section{Phylogenetic Trees}

Phylogenetic trees characterize evolutionary relationships.
\subsection{Neighbor Joining}

Neighbor Joining is a common distance-based phylogenetic method.

\section{Phylogenetic Networks}

Phylogenetic networks generalize phylogenetic trees.

\subsection{Split Decomposition}

Split decomposition can take a distance matrix and reduce it to a set of weighted splits.

\section{Reticulation Quantification Using Homology}

There are some flaws in the original Vietoris-Rips construction.
This approach generalizes that construction in order to recover additive trees.

\section{Experiments}

Think of some experiments that we can do.
