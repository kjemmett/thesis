\chapter{Prokaryote Reticulate Evolution - Tree of Life}
\label{ch:prokaryotes}

One of the goals of the project was to present an atlernative construction for the prokaryotic tree of life.
To do so we used COG data.
We plugged it in to persistent homology to scope out the barcode diagram/
then we plugged that into ayasdi to make an interesting figure.
