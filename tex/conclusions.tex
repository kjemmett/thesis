\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{ch:conclusions}

In this thesis, we have primarily considered the problem of characterizing nonvertical modes of evolution in large-scale genomic data.
We have drawn on methods from topological data analysis in this task.
In so doing, we have developed a framework for statistical inference using persistence diagrams.
In this thesis we considered several problems in genomic and evolution.
Future work will continue in this direction.
