\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{ch:conclusions}

In this thesis, we have primarily considered the problem of characterizing nonvertical modes of evolution in large-scale genomic data.
We have drawn on methods from topological data analysis in this task.
We have developed 
In so doing, we have developed a framework for statistical inference using persistence diagrams.
In this thesis we considered several problems in genomic and evolution.
Future work will continue in this direction.

[List of things we can work on in the future.]
Some other salient comments...

Need to develop more modeling.
What essentiality do models have

Some concluding remarks about when persistent homology is useful.
Need to understand what higher homology is telling you.
