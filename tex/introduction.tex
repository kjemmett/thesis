%\epigraph{``As buds give rise by growth to fresh buds, and these, if vigorous, branch out and overtop on all sides many a feebler branch, so by generation I believe it has been with the great Tree of Life, which fills with its dead and broken branches the crust of the earth, and covers the surface with its ever-branching and beautiful ramifications.''}{Charles Darwin, 1872}

Darwin's \emph{On the Origin of Species} contains a single figure, depicting the ancestry of species as a branching genealogical tree \cite{Darwin:1859uh} (see Figure \ref{fig:darwin_origin}).
Since then, the tree structure has been the dominant framework to understand, visualize, and communicate discoveries about evolution.
Indeed, a primary focus of evolutionary biology has been to expand the \emph{universal tree of life}, the set of evolutionary relationships among all extant and extinct organisms on Earth \cite{Bowler:2003uz}.
Traditionally, this was the realm of phenotype-derived taxonomies.
With the advent of molecular data and computational approaches for tree-inference, evolutionary biology has become a truly quantitative discipline.
Molecular phylogenetics, which uses genetic sequence data to construct trees, has become the standard tool for inferring evolutionary relationships.
A tree is only accurate if the Darwinian model of descent via reproduction with modification is the sole process driving evolution.
Yet it has long been recognized that there exist alterative evolutionary processes that can allow organisms to exchange genetic material through means beyond reproduction \cite{Arnold:2007vq}.
Notable examples include horizontal gene transfer in bacteria, species hybridization in plants, and meiotic recombination in eukaryotes.
Collectively, these processes are known as \emph{reticulate evolution}.
These stand in contast to descent with modification, an example of \emph{clonal evolution}.\footnote{Clonal and reticulate evolution are also known by the terms \emph{vertical} and \emph{horizontal}, respectively.}
Increasing genomic data, powered by new high-throughput sequencing technologies, has shown that these reticulate processes are more prevalent than originally expected.
For some, this has called into question the tree of life hypothesis as an organizing principle and prompted the search for new ways of representing evolutionary relationships \cite{Doolittle:1999,OMalley:2011tu}.

The aim of this thesis is to present new ways of quantifying and representing reticulate evolutionary processes using recently developed tools from algebraic and computational topology.
These tools fall under the collective heading of \emph{topological data analysis}, a new branch of applied topology concerned with inferring structure in high-dimensional data sets.
In the following brief introduction, we survey salient aspects of molecular evolution, the tree paradigm, and the challenges therein.
We then introduce the idea of representing evolution as a topological space and give a flavor of the results to be discussed.

\section{Molecular Evolution and the Tree Paradigm}

The combination of Darwin's ideas of natural selection with Mendelian genetics led to the \emph{modern evolutionary synthesis}, outlined in the first half of the twentieth century in pioneering works by Fisher, Wright, Haldane, and others (see \cite{Huxley:1942} and \cite{Gould:2002ts} for historical detail).
The modern synthesis was based largely on analysis of distributions of allele frequencies in distinct populations, the purview of classical population genetics.
The field was placed on molecular foundations with the Watson and Crick's discovery of the DNA double-helix in 1953 \cite{Watson:1953wm}.
These developments led to the modern study of \emph{molecular evolution}, the analysis of how processes such as mutation, drift, and recombination act at the cellular level to induce changes in populations and species.
While molecular biology has focused on the biochemical and biophysial mechanisms underlying these processes, \emph{molecular phylogenetics} has focused on comparison of macromolecular sequences to infer genealogies and evolutionary relationships.
Molecular phylogenetics began with Zuckerkandl and Pauling's recognition that the information encoded in the molecular sequences could be used as a document of evolutionary history in the early 1960's \cite{Zuckerkandl:1962,Zuckerkandl:1965wi}.
Since that time, the development of numerical approaches for inferring evolutionary relationships has evolved into a mature discipline, with new methods being frequently proposed.
The use of molecular sequence data to infer phylogeny is a standard practice across a wide range of biology and ecology.

Two historical results, one from molecular evolution and one from molecular phylogenetics, are worth mentioning.
First, Motoo Kimura's neutral theory of evolution, first detailed in 1968 \cite{Kimura:1968vw} (see \cite{Kimura:1984} for a comprehensive survey).
The neutral theory holds that observed genetic diversity is largely a result of genetic drift.
At the time the neutral theory was proposed, most biologists assumed that natural selection was the driving force behind genetic diversity.
Kimura argued that at the molecular level, the vast majority of mutations are selectively neutral, that is they confer no fitness advantage to the individual organism.
With increased sequencing of organisms and populations, tests for selection based on the neutral theory have been developed.

Second, Carl Woese's organization of bacteria, eukarya, and archaea into the three domains of life \cite{Woese:1977vd}.
Prior to Woese, there were two recognized domains of life: prokaryotes, single-celled organisms lacking a nucleus, and eukaryotes, multi-celled organisms with an enveloped nucleus.
Using 16S subunit ribosomal RNA sequencing, Woese discovered that the prokaryotic domain actually split into two evolutionarily distinct classes.
One of these, which he termed \emph{archaebacteria} was more closely related to eukaryotes than were there the rest of the prokaryotes.
This led to the three-domain system of life.

This work had several important consequences.
First, it established the use of molecular data to inform about patterns of evolutionary history.
Using only morphological data led to an inconsistent classification of archaea.
Second, it positioned 16S rRNA profiling as the primary source of data for use in comparative genomics.
The use of this genomic region was justified on the basis of being one of the few universal gene segments  that is orthologous across all species.
Finally, it solidified the tree paradigm as the organizing principle for relating extant species.

However, despite the significant impact this observation had, there remains a subtle difficulty, which Woese himself came to contemplate in later work.
Woese's phylogeny was based on only 1,500 nucleotides in the ribosomal RNA, less than 1\% of the length of a typical bacterial genome (see \cite{Dagan:2006up}).
Even more striking, this accounts for less than 0.00005\% of the human genome.
While recent work has developed approaches for constructing universal trees from larger gene sets \cite{Ciccarelli:2006gw}, the fact remains that the vast majority of genomic information is \emph{not} incorporated into the tree.

The reason for this situation is the presence of nonvertical evolutionary forces, as alluded to above.
If one were to use a different genomic region to construct atree of species, a different tree topology would be generated.
These processes have been well known for some time!
Horizontal exchange occurs when a donor bacteria transmits foreign DNA into a genetically distinct bacteria strain.
Three mechanisms of horizontal transfer are identified, depending on the route by which foreign DNA is acquired \cite{Ochman:2000dr}.
Foreign DNA can be acquired via uptake from an external environment (transformation), via viral-mediated processes (transduction), or via direct cell-to-cell contact between bacterial strains (conjugation).

Nonvertical modes of evolution are more than just a theoretical concern:
In HIV, frequent recombination confounds our understanding of the early and present epidemicâ€™s history \kje{[cite]}.
In influenza, gene reassortments lead to antigenic novelty and the emergenence of epidemics \kje{[cite]}.
In several pathogenic bacteria, including E. coli and S. aureus, horizontal gene transfer has been responsbile for the spread of antibiotic resistance \kje{[cite]}.

One wonders if the information deduced from small genomic sections can be extrapolated to other regions, as different gene sequences can yield vastly different tree topologies.
Incompatibilities in the tree model now appear as the rule, not the exception, demonstrating the need for new representations of evolutionary relationships \autocite{Doolittle:1999,Doolittle:2006}.
Many have argued that, in light of genomic evidence of HGT, the very notion of a universal tree of life must be discarded. \kje{[cite Doolittle, Koonin]}.
These and other similar situations, further described below, call for new methods of characterizing evolutionary relationships.

\section{Evolution as a Topological Space}

In this work, we propose the use of new computational techniques, borrowed from the field of algebraic topology, to capture and represent complex patterns of nonvertical evolution.
While this may sound obscure, let us unpack the basic idea.

Topology as a field is concerned with properties of spaces that are invariant under continuous deformation.
Such properties can include connectedness and the presence of holes, for example.
As a paradigmatic example, consider the coffee mug and the donut (Figure~\ref{intro:fig:coffeemug_to_donut}).
These two objects are topologically equivalent to $D^2\times S^1$.
That is, there is one connected component and one hole.
Algebraic topology quantifies our intuitive notions of shape by associating algebraic structures to different invariants.
The most relevant invariants for our purposes will be the \emph{Betti numbers}, which measure.
We give a more complete characterization of Betti numbers in Chapter~\ref{ch:background}, but a flavor is as follows.
First, we can think of $b_0$ as representing the number of connected components, or clusters, in our space.
Next, we can think of $b_1$ as representing the number of loops in our space.
Equivalently, this is the number of cuts needed to transform the space into something contractible to a point.
Higher Betti numbers, $b_n$ for $n>1$ will correspond to higher dimensional holes.
In our coffee mug example, we have $b_0=1$, $b_1=1$, and $b_n=0$ for $n>1$.

Consider again Darwin's branching phylogeny (Figure~\ref{fig:darwin_origin}) and Doolittle's modified tree accounting for nonvertical processes (Figure~\ref{fig:doolittle_tree}).
Imagine these representations as topological spaces.
The branching phylogeny has a simple topology, being trivially contractible to a point.
In contrast, Doolittle's construction has a much more complex topology, with many holes formed at points where nonvertical processes have occurred.
We will adopt a similar perspective to the coffee mug example and characterize evolutionary spaces as topological spaces using Betti numbers.

To give the very simplest example, consider Figure~\ref{intro:fig:simple_tree_example}.
On the left we have a simple rooted three leaf evolutionary topology.
We have a single connected component that is trivially contractible, giving $b_0=1$ and $b_1=0$.
On the right, we have a reticulate topology again involving three leaves.
We can envision the center leaf as being a reticulate offspring of parents ancestral to the left and right leaves.
Accounting for this generates a single loop, giving $b_0=1$ and $b_1=1$.
The Betti numbers capture the essential difference in the two evolutionary histories.

The remainder of this thesis focuses on expanding upon this idea and applying it to real data sets with the goal of measuring the prevalence and scale of nonvertical evolutionary events.
Several immediate questions arise, for instance: how to construct topological spaces from finite samples, how to make comparisons among gene sets, and how to handle extinct organisms.
We will address these questions, and in doing so develop new techniques to construct and extract statistical information from topological spaces.

In this thesis, we use new computational techniques, borrowed from the field of algebraic topology, to capture and represent complex patterns of gene exchange that are obscurbed in current phylogenetic methods.
By doing so, we provide a fuller understanding of evolutionary relationships than allowed by current phylogenetic methods.
Genomic exchange can be characterized by the parental sequences involved in the exchange, by the amount and identity of material exchanged (i.e., the genes or loci involved), and the frequency with which similar exchanges occur.
Techniques such as phylogenetic networks and ancestral recombination graphs have been developed to describe reticulate evolution, but they have had only limited success due to difficulties of biological interpretation and computational infeasibility in all but the smallest datasets.

Linkage-based techniques have succeeded in measuring rates of recombination in medium-sized datasets (<200 sequences), but they cannot reveal the scale of these exchanges (i.e., the genetic distance between parental sequences), and they have limited resolution in pinpointing where along a genome such exchanges have occurred.
A new mathematical foundation is needed to move beyond these limitations.
Genome evolution is an extremely rich subject [cite Genome Architecture book].

\section{Thesis Organization}

The remainder of this thesis is organized as follows.

In Chapter \ref{ch:background} we present background information on the wide range of topics discussed in this thesis.
This discussion is chiefly structured into two pieces: (1) background on phylogenetics and population genetics, and (2) background on the methods we use from topological data analysis.

In Part \ref{part:theory}, we develop two complementary approaches for analyzing genomic data using topological data analysis.
In Chapter \ref{ch:complex_construction}, we propose alternative methods of constructing topological complexes that generalize the traditional Vietoris-Rips and \Cech complexes but are suited to the particular requirements of phylogenetic applications.
We draw on previous work in phylogenetic networks and use homology to provide a quantitative assessment of reticulation.
This work was published in \cite{Emmett:2015a}.
In Chapter \ref{ch:parametric_inference}, we develop methods for performing statistical inference using summary statistics contained in the persistence diagram.
This is the first such use of persistence diagrams as a tool for performing parametric inference. This work was published in \cite{Emmett:2014b}

In Part \ref{part:applications}, we apply our approach to several problems in evolution and genomics.


In Part \ref{part:application_microorganism} we apply our approach to various microorganism datasets.
In Chapter \ref{ch:phage} we study bacteriophages.
In Chapter \ref{ch:influenza} we study influenza.
In Chapter \ref{ch:pathogens} we study pathogenic bacteria and use topological techniques to represent the spread of antibiotic resistance.
In Chapter \ref{ch:prokaryotes} we study prokaryotic evolution and species tree topologies.

In Part \ref{part:applications_human}, we apply our approaches to a several problems in human population genetics and biology.
In Chapter \ref{ch:human_recombination_rate} we use population data to measure human recombination rates and identify recombination hotspots.
We identify variation in recombination hotspots in different human populations.
In Chapter \ref{ch:human_chromatin_folding} we analyze Hi-C data to explore patterns of chromatin folding in the nucleus in both prokaryotic and human datasets.
\kje{[Hi-C work includes more than human data, and the population structure work will not be included -- rename this part?]}

Finally, in Chapter \ref{ch:conclusions} we summarize these results and present future research directions.
