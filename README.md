### Background

* Major section: population genetics and phylogenetics.
* Discuss Darwin, Woese, Doolittle.
* Discuss the coalescent with recombination. Biological mechanisms of recombination and horizontal gene transfer
* Discuss phylogenetics and networks. Split networks here or later?

* Major section: Applied topology
* Discuss group theory, equivalence classes, homology.
* Lead up to persistent homology.
* Discuss developments in statistical TDA.
