## Topology of Reticulate Evolution
## Kevin Emmett

Brief Abstract

Table of Contents

### Introduction

* Open with Darwin's Tree of Life
* Recapitulate the Doolittle story and run through some history.
* Darwin -> Zuckerkandl/Pauling -> Woese -> Modern Genomics
* Doolittle; evidence for nonvertical evolution; new models

* Propose topological data analysis as a possible framework
* Describe the basic idea behind TDA
* Give a simple picture for how TDA is applied to sequence data
* Thesis Organization

### Background

* Major section: survey of evolutionary biology, population genetics and phylogenetics.
* Sequence alignment. Coalescent simulation.
* Discuss Darwin, Zuckerkandl and Pauling, Woese, Doolittle.
* LUCA. Universal Tree of Life. Powerful image!
* But evidence that evolution is not as linear as Darwin thought.
* Discuss the coalescent with recombination. Biological mechanisms of recombination and horizontal gene transfer
* Discuss phylogenetics and phylogenetic networks.
* Detailed information can be put in later sections
* Infinite sites assumption

#### Population Genetics

* Gene Genealogies, Variation and Evolution [Hein, Schierup, Wiuf]
* ReCombinatorics [Gusfield]
