## Topology of Reticulate Evolution
## Kevin Emmett

### Introduction

* Open with Darwin's Tree of Life
* Recapitulate the Doolittle story and run through some history.
* Darwin -> Zuckerkandl/Pauling -> Woese -> Modern Genomics
* Doolittle; evidence for nonvertical evolution; new models

* Propose topological data analysis as a possible framework
* Describe the basic idea behind TDA
* Give a simple picture for how TDA is applied to sequence data
* Thesis Organization

### Background

* Major section: survey of evolutionary biology, population genetics and phylogenetics.
* Sequence alignment. Coalescent simulation.
* Discuss Darwin, Zuckerkandl and Pauling, Woese, Doolittle.
* LUCA. Universal Tree of Life. Powerful image!
* But evidence that evolution is not as linear as Darwin thought.
* Discuss the coalescent with recombination. Biological mechanisms of recombination and horizontal gene transfer
* Discuss phylogenetics and phylogenetic networks.
* Detailed information can be put in later sections
* Infinite sites assumption

#### Population Genetics

* Gene Genealogies, Variation and Evolution [Hein, Schierup, Wiuf]
* ReCombinatorics [Gusfield]


## Pr√©cis

In the first chapter, we show how the information in the persistence diagram can be used in parameteric models for statistical inference. We will illustrate this with a number of simple examples, and then demonstrate statistical inference in a more complex model drawn from population genetics.

We illustrate our approach with an initial application to inference in a Gaussian Random Field model.
This model will be used in later chapters when applied to real data. This approach of making statistical statements about the persistence diagram differs from that of previous approaches for statistical information
