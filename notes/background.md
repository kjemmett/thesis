(infinite sites model and binary sequences)

In the majority of our cases, we will work under the so called \emph{infinite sites model}.
The model assumes no double mutations occur.
The justification for the model is that because the probability of a double mutation goes as $1/L^2$ where $L$ is the length of the genome, double mutations will be extremely rare over time scales we are interested in.
A consequence of this model is that we can safely assume binary sequence data, where `0' implies unmutated and `1' implies mutated.
If two organisms share a mutation, we know they shared a common ancestor with that mutation at some point in the past.
While this may seem like a strong assumption, it holds quite well for

We give a concrete example on four leaves.
We consider only segregating sites.
Consider the set of four sequences S = {00000, 11000, 10110, 10101}.

One possible unrooted tree topology representing the data is shown in Figure XX.

A few things are worth noting in this example.
One, each segregating site is associated with an edge in the
