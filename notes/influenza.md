Virology:

Then I show persistent homology for different data sets - avian vs human? different reassortment patterns?

Epidemio

------------------------

To test our model on biological data, we considered reassortment in avian influenza virus.
Influenza is a single-stranded RNA virus that is naturally found in avian populations.
Each viral genome has eight genetic segments.
Subtypes are defined by two segments, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), e.g. H1N1 and H3N2.
When a host	 cell is coinfected with two different viral strains, reassortment of these segments can occur, such that viral offspring is a genetic mixture of the two parental strains.
Reassortment is of substantial medical interest, and has been connected with the outbreak of influenza epidemics.


things we did:
applied PH to flu sequences
applied to segments individually -- no H1 homology
applied PH to concatenated sequences -- lots of higher homology
used to estimate recombination rates
looked at $H_1$ pairwise - determined that polymerase complex goes together.
[consistent with Greenbaum]

Important question: human adaptation
Pandemics: 1918 Spanish flu, 1957 Asian flu, 1968 Hong Kong, 2009 H1N1
Outbreaks: 2015 H5N2

[from nelson 2007]
Host species barriers.
Pandemic potential.
Natural host reservoir.
 Wild waterfowl are the reservoir hosts for type A influenza viruses, harboring numerous antigenically distinct subtypes (serotypes) of the two main viral antigens, the haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) sur- face glycoproteins (16 HA and 9 NA subtypes).

Include discussion of antigenic effects.
Combined effect of genetic drift and reassortment.

Experimental studies have shown that reassortment occurs at high frequency when segments do not mismatch \cite{Marshall:2013kn}.
This type of reassortment would be difficult to capture in our approach.

Rates of reassortment were first measured in \cite{Macken:2006jw}
