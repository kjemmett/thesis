% Topological Data Analysis
% Second Attempt

Topology is the branch of mathematics that aims to characterize spaces up deformation.
If we start
Algebraic topology assigns algebraic quantities to these invariants.

Topological Data Analysis (TDA) refers to a set of tools that have been developed over the past decade aimed at computing topological invariants from data.
These tools have been developed extensively through collaborations between mathematicians and computer scientists.


The two main computational tools which we will employ in this thesis are \emph{peristent homology} and \emph{mapper}.
In this section we describe both of these tools.
We take a pipeline approach, where the input to each method is the data, and the output is some topological summary of the data.
Each step of the pipline involves some type of transformation of the data.
We describe each step of the pipeline in turn.

The exposition is designed to be straight-forward and self-contained.
Further exposition can be found in Appendix \ref{ap:algtop}.
