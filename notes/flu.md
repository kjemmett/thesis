Influenza

Influenza is a single-stranded RNA virus of family orthomyxoviridae.
Naturally found in avian populations.


Segmented genome. Eight segments. 

Surface antigens: HA and NA.
Polymerase complex: PB1, PB2, PA.

Important question: human adaptation.

Pandemics: 1918 Spanish flu, 1957 Asian flu, 1968 Hong Kong, 2009 H1N1
Outbreaks: 2015 H5N2

virulence / transmissibility balance

- Lots of data. Concerted effort to sequence influenza genomes since early 2000s. Over 15,000 complete genomes, 400,000 unique sequences. Unprecedented longitudinal sampling. Good test bed for large scale methods.


things we did:
applied PH to flu sequences
applied to segments individually -- no H1 homology
applied PH to concatenated sequences -- lots of higher homology
used to estimate recombination rates
looked at H1 pairwise - determined that polymerase complex goes together.
[consistent with greenbaum]

annotated generates based on subtype
identified a 'genetic barrier' between intersubtype recombination
